# ICLR_2025_project
ML analysis of the complex ICLR 2025 peer review dataset, integrating both textual and quantitative data. 
- regression, classical classifiers, recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
- unsupervised topic clustering using TF-IDF  combined with K-means uncovers emerging research themes.
- long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and state-of-the-art transformer-based model (DistilBERT)
- extensive hyperparameter optimization and stratified data splitting reveal that transformer architectures, par-
ticularly DistilBERT, outperform traditional models in accurately classifying reviewer ratings while efectively
managing class imbalance.
